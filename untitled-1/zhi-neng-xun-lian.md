## **Unknown questions learning**

Unknown question learning is to summarize and extract the questions that the robot cannot answer, so that the administrator can improve the answer to the questions and improve the accuracy of the robot's answer.

Select Add, the question will become a new standard question. Select Ignore, the question will no longer appear in the list of unknown questions.

## **Unsatisfied learning**

Unsatisfied questions learning is to show the questions that are regarded as unsatisfied for more than 5 times, and administrators can operate on these dissatisfied questions. "Add as New Question" is to edit and sort out the question into a new standard question, while "Answer Correction" is to modify and authenticate the answers of unsatisfactory questions. "Ignore" means the question will no longer appear in the unsatisfied question list.

## Similar questions learning

The similar questions learning is to classify and statistically display the questions that are not in the standard questions of the knowledge base or in the similar questions, but have been asked by users for many times. Administrators can review these questions. "Pass" means that the question conforms to the corresponding knowledge points so that it can officially become similar question. "Ignore" means the question will no longer appear in this section. Add as New Question will set the question as a new standard question.
