### **Professional Q&As**

Professional question and answer is a knowledge reserve related to business and is also the basis for robot training. The knowledge base supports uploading item-by-item or by batch. When you upload by batch, download the batch upload-template firstly, and then fill in the knowledge base according to the format requirements, and click the Upload. 

| Project | Illustration |
| :--- | :--- |
| Standard | Standard questions refer to the main questions related to business. The more standard questions, the higher the accuracy of robot answers. |
| Classification | Classification refers to classifying the categories of issues. Up to two levels of classification can be added, such as Order Issue/Refund |

After batch import, problem classification will be automatically created in the background according to the classification of problems, and the knowledge base can be operated and managed according to the classification. Classification is convenient for querying and managing the knowledge base, and also convenient for statistical analysis of user problems.

When the data in the knowledge base needs to be updated, click "Edit" to enter the problem editing page. At the same time, it supports the export of knowledge base data.

### Similar questions recommendation

Similar questions recommendation is a similar question recommended by machine according to the imported standard problem, so as to better improve the accuracy of the robot. The entry of similar problem recommendation function is shown in the following picture:
