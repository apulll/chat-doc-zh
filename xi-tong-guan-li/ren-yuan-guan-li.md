# Personnel management

## Account management

In account management, you can add an account. In addition to setting the account password and name, you also need to configure the role of the account. Different roles determine different permissions to the system.

## Role management

In role management, you can view existing role permissions and add roles at the same time. At present, the background permission types are divided into administrators and customer service personnel, and different role permissions are selected according to different role types.
